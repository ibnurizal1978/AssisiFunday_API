## About Assisi Funday
<br/><br/>
Assisi Funday is a Singapore-based multi-tenant e-commerce platform that uniquely integrates interactive gaming features. Users can play various games to earn points, which can then be redeemed as discounts when purchasing items on the website. To ensure a seamless shopping experience, the platform is fully integrated with online payment systems, allowing users to make secure transactions via credit cards.
<br/><br/>
The platform also provides robust management tools for tenants, enabling them to monitor incoming orders, update order statuses, and generate e-vouchers for visitors. These e-vouchers can be redeemed by website visitors when making offline purchases at the tenants' physical retail outlets.
